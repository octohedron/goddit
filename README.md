## Features

- Crawls popular subreddits (first 25) and adds them as chatrooms in a separate `goroutine` (for faster startup) when you start the program
- Loads previous chatroom history (up to 150 messages) when switching rooms
- Authorizes via reddit and pairs a `cookie` with a user in the server for Authorization
- Only broadcasts messages to those present in the room, not to others in different rooms
- Different color avatars, autogenerated from [placeskull.com](http://placeskull.com)
- Enforces a single `WebSocket` for each client, closing the connection when switching rooms
- Each client reads and writes to a different `goroutine` (2 goroutines/client)
- Database writes are performed in a separate `goroutine`
